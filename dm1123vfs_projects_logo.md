## PROJECT: LOGO

#### Create a logo for your selected brand in Adobe Illustrator.

* Select a brand that is personal to you in some way. 
* It could be your own, a friend’s, or a family member’s. 
* Throughout the semester, we’ll be investigating ways to visually communicate this brand, through creating an identity system which will consist of a logo, an interface, and a physical application.

### LOGO 1st Draft

* Post to your tumblr or wordpress 
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description \(1 to 2 sentences max\) of your brand
* **At least 10 different versions of logo** iterations of your selected brand **ALL in grayscale \(this includes black & white\)**
* One logo version per 8 1/2 x 11 \(letter\) dimensions
  * a big version \(and a tiny version \(a little bigger than postage size\) in the corner\)
  * at least 3 should be digital
  * at least 3 should be haptic \(non-digital\) 
  * You will need to digitize haptic files \(i.e. scan or take a digital photo, etc.\)
* Also, consider creating haptic / digital combos
* To comprise your different versions, play around with creating [icons/symbols, logotypes, and/or combination logos](http://www.logodesignsource.com/types.html)
* It could also be a redesign of an existing personal logo. If so, please post the original logo as well

### LOGO 2nd Draft

* Post to your tumblr or wordpress
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description \(1 to 2 sentences max\) of your brand
* Select at least 2 different versions, and create

  **at least 5 different variations of each version** \(for a total of 10 at a minimum iterations in grayscale \(black & white\) or color based on each version selected in the previous class crit\).

* One logo per letter dimensions \( 8 1/2 x 11\) with a big version \(and a tiny version \(a little bigger than postage size\) in the corner\)

### LOGO Final

* Post to your tumblr or wordpress
* Add the name of your personal brand, along with a very brief description \(1 to 2 sentences max\) of your brand
* In order to come to your final logo, you will have to do many more iterations of your selected logo version. I would like to see the iterations you made to get to your final logo, as well.
* **Final logo** in color and letter dimensions \(8 1/2 x 11\) with a big version \(and a tiny version \(a little bigger than postage size\) in the corner\)
