# PROJECT: INTERFACE
Using a combination of Illustrator and/or Photoshop, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice (game, website, mobile application, digital kiosk, etc).

#### INTERFACE Wireframes (and, if applicable, Sitemap)     
Post on your process website in grayscale (includes black and white). 
* (if applicable) create a sitemap
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale (includes black and white)
* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions (8 1/2 x 11). 
* Every, single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text. Use Real Text.
* Consult the readings and/or VFS <a href="dm1123_vfs_recommended_resources.html">resources</a> 

#### INTERFACE Wireframes (and, if applicable, Sitemap) Iteration  
* (If instructed by professor) Iterate your Wireframes and/or Sitemap

#### INTERFACE Comp 
Comp is short for composition or layout. A comp looks EXACTLY as it will appear in its final form; it's just NOT clickable in the case of a website, game, or digital kiosk, etc.

* Create a comp of your interface 
    * The home page / screen and one other page (UNLESS you're doing a one-page scroller)
* Post on your process website
