## PROJECT: INTERFACE

Using a combination of Illustrator and/or Photoshop, apply your brand to a digital interface of your choice \(game, website, mobile application, digital kiosk, etc\).

### INTERFACE Wireframes \(and, if applicable, Sitemap\)

Post on your process website in grayscale \(includes black and white\).

* \(if applicable\) create a sitemap
  * If you are doing a website, you also need to include a sitemap in grayscale \(includes black and white\)
* Create a wireframe of your interface in letter dimensions \(8 1/2 x 11\). 
* Every, single element needs to be accounted for including controls, text, images, videos, and supporting graphics. 
* Do not use Lorem Ipsum for text. Use Real Text.
* Consult the readings and/or VFS [resources](https://github.com/deangela/visual-foundation-studio-fall-2017/tree/ee70765c00c7660151e490d1c31340d42f327877/dm1123_vfs_recommended_resources.html) 

### INTERFACE Wireframes \(and, if applicable, Sitemap\) Iteration

* \(If instructed by professor\) Iterate your Wireframes and/or Sitemap
* Post on your process website

### INTERFACE Comp

Comp is short for composition or layout. A comp looks EXACTLY as it will appear in its final form; it's just NOT clickable in the case of a website, game, or digital kiosk, etc.

* Create a comp of your interface 
  * The home page / screen and one other page \(UNLESS you're doing a one-page scroller\)
* Post on your process website
