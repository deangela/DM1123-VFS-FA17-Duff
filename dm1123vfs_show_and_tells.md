### Logo SHOW & TELL Directions
* Select an established brand that has had at least 3 logo iterations (ideally more) over the years. Think outside the box. 
* Post your selection on Slack in the VFS channel.
  * One brand per student. 
  * Two students can not do the same brand. 
  * First student who posts their choice on slack gets the brand.
* Create a **8 minutes or less** presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.) that shows and discusses the history of the evolution of the logo. 
* You should find out the name of the logo designer (if you can), the dates that the logo was redesigned, and why it was redesigned.
* Cite your sources.
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools)
  * Get familiar with your display preferences
* If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to **Crestron**.
