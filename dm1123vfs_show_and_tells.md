### Logo SHOW & TELL Directions

  * Two students can not do the same brand. 
  * First student who posts their choice on slack gets the brand.
* Create a **8 minutes or less** presentation \(pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.\) that shows and discusses the history of the evolution of the logo. 
* You should find out the name of the logo designer \(if you can\), the dates that the logo was redesigned, and why it was redesigned.
* Cite your sources.
* Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not \(if you're using presentation tools\)
  * Get familiar with your display preferences
* If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to **Crestron**.
